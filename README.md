# word-guess-game
In this game, there is a list of words present, out of which our interpreter will choose 1 random character. The user first has to input their names, and then, will be asked to guess any alphabet. If the random word contains that alphabet, it will be shown as the output (with correct placement); otherwise, the program will ask you to guess another alphabet. The user will be given 8 turns (which can be changed accordingly) to guess the complete word.
